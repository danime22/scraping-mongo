# Mongo Scraper

Mongo Scraper is a simple app developed for the Fall 2018 Cohort of the SMU coding bootcamp. This application demonstrates how to scrape a website for data using Cheerio. In this application, the Huffington Post news site is scraped for articles. The title, image, url and author as well as a link to the article is saved to this application's MongoDB. Users may then add comments to articles as well as edit and delete them.
